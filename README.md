<h2 align="left">About me</h2>

###

<p align="left">
I am an Italian student passionate about computer science. Iâ€™ve explored various areas of computer science to get a broad view and figure out my specialization. I started with Java, then moved to C++ with debugging tools like GDB and Ghidra to understand code internally. I wrote small x64 Assembly programs to deepen my low-level knowledge. I also studied networking basics to understand packet operations. Now, when coding, I usually have an idea of where bugs might originate from.
