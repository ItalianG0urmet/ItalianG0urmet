<h2 align="left">About me</h2>

###

<p align="left">
Hi, I'm Francesco â€” also known as <em>Gourmet</em> online. I'm passionate about computers and love understanding how they work under the hood. I'm constantly learning and exploring computer science topics, and I've been diving into books like <em>Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective</em> and <em>Programming from the Ground Up</em>.<br><br>
C is my favorite programming language â€” I really appreciate its simplicity and power. That said, I actually started out with Java, which I still use regularly. I'm always aiming to improve and write cleaner, more professional code.<br><br>
Overall, I've worked with various technologies and tools. I've been using Linux as my main desktop environment for several years now, and I've gained experience with several programming languages like C++, Kotlin, and of course C and Java.<br><br>
Feel free to check out my repositories and donâ€™t hesitate to reach out if youâ€™re interested in working together or just want to chat about tech!
</p>
