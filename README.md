### 👨‍💻 Who am I?
Hi! I'm a student passionate about **Reverse Engineering**. I'm learning to explore, decode, and understand software, systems, and protocols to discover vulnerabilities, optimize code, and gain a deeper knowledge of how things work "behind the scenes."

### 🔍 What I Do
I'm focused on analyzing software and applications to uncover their hidden secrets. Some of the techniques and tools I work with include:

- **Disassembly and decompilation**: I use tools like Binary Ninja and Ghidra to explore binary code.
- **Debugging**: I work with debuggers like x64dbg to analyze and manipulate software behavior.

### 🌱 What I’m Learning
I'm currently deepening my knowledge in:

- **Operating System Security**
- **Reverse Engineering on windows and linux applications**

### 💡 Experience with Java (Spigot/Bukkit) and Golang
In addition to reverse engineering, I’ve developed **custom plugins** and **applications** using **Java** and **Go**. I have a particular focus on **Minecraft server development** with **Spigot/Bukkit**, where I enjoy creating unique gameplay mechanics and server tools.
